# Asset Licensing

## Logo and Icons

Addeo's logo and icons were commissioned from and created by the exceptional 
[design_house01](https://www.fiverr.com/design_house01) on Fiverr. These
assets (including [addeo_logo.png](addeo_logo.png), 
[icon16.png](../src/addeo/img/icon16.png), 
[icon48.png](../src/addeo/img/icon48.png), and 
[icon128.png](../src/addeo/img/icon128.png) [note: the icons as such were not 
among the original purchased files but were produced from the purchased files 
by septagon, the purchaser and owner]), are made available here under the 
terms of the Creative Commons license 
[CC BY-NC-ND 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). As 
noted in the [README](../README.md), this relatively restrictive asset license 
was chosen for these logos and icons largely by default; if you have reason to 
believe a difference license would be more appropriate, please open a GitHub
issue in which to discuss it.
